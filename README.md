## FAQ
* Q: License?
* A: I didn't code any of these, these are either reprogrammed verbatim or directly downloaded from my calculator (Depending on length).
* Q: How do I add scripts?
* A: Make a pull request to the [development](../../tree/development) branch
* Q: How can I create/edit files?
* A: On a calculator, with TI Connect, or with an IDE (https://github.com/ItsMajestiX/VSCode-Ti may be promising)
