## FAQ
* Q: How do I use these?
* A: Download TI-Connect and connect your calculator to your computer or reprogram the scripts by hand.
* Q: How do I add scripts?
* A: Make a pull request to the [development](../../tree/development) branch
* Q: How can I create/edit files?
* A: On a calculator, with TI Connect, or with an IDE (https://github.com/ItsMajestiX/VSCode-Ti may be promising)
